            <p> Global warming is a nature-related phenomenon caused by the accumulation of the greenhouse effect, which leads to
                an
                imbalance between the energy absorbed and the energy emitted by the earth's atmosphere, and the accumulation of
                energy
                in thearth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in temperature and resulting in global warming.</p>
            <p id="C1">As people burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal, or cut down forests and burn them, they produce large amounts
                of
                carbon dioxide, or greenhouse gases, which are highly permeable to visible light from the sun and highly
                absorbent to
                long-wave radiation emitted from the earth, strongly absorbing infrared light from terrestrial radiation and
                causing the
                earth's temperature to rise, i.e. the greenhouse effect. Global warming will cause global redistribution of
                precipitation, melting of glaciers and permafrost, and rising sea levels, which not only endangers the balance
                of
                natural ecosystems, but also affects human health and even threatens the survival of human beings.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, as greenhouse gas emissions from land cause the temperature on the continent to rise, the
                temperature
                difference with the ocean becomes smaller, which in turn causes the air flow to slow down and the haze cannot be
                blown
                away for a short period of time, resulting in an increase in hazy weather in many cities and affecting human
                health.
                Measures such as car restrictions and production moratoriums have only short-term and localized effects and do
                not
                fundamentally change the warming climate and haze pollution. </p>
