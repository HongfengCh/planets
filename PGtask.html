    <p>Global warming is a nature-related phenomenon caused by the accumulation of the greenhouse effect, which leads to
        an
        imbalance between the energy absorbed and the energy emitted by the earth's atmosphere, and the accumulation of
        energy
        in thearth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in temperature and resulting in global warming.</p>
    <p>As people burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal, or cut down forests and burn them, they produce large amounts
        of
        carbon dioxide, or greenhouse gases, which are highly permeable to visible light from the sun and highly
        absorbent to
        long-wave radiation emitted from the earth, strongly absorbing infrared light from terrestrial radiation and
        causing the
        earth's temperature to rise, i.e. the greenhouse effect. Global warming will cause global redistribution of
        precipitation, melting of glaciers and permafrost, and rising sea levels, which not only endangers the balance
        of
        natural ecosystems, but also affects human health [13] and even threatens the survival of human beings.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, as greenhouse gas emissions from land cause the temperature on the continent to rise, the
        temperature
        difference with the ocean becomes smaller, which in turn causes the air flow to slow down and the haze cannot be
        blown
        away for a short period of time, resulting in an increase in hazy weather in many cities and affecting human
        health.
        Measures such as car restrictions and production moratoriums have only short-term and localized effects and do
        not
        fundamentally change the warming climate and haze pollution. </p>
